Meeting Notes

Sergio Chanel
Hey, tech guys, I found a thumb drive on the second floor near the HR area. I don't know whose it is and I don't really care either. I'm going to come drop it off later today because I'm sure you have more use for it than I do

Gilly Bates
I ran into Sergio in the halls and he handed me a random flash drive with little explanation but he said he made a ticket for it.

Anyways, I put it on your desk to look at, @playerone

@playerone, we have no idea where that drive came from, but it could be infected with viruses. I've heard from some forums I frequent that a lot of other sysadmins are trying to figure out the best way to stop USB drives from walking in the door and being plugged in by curious folks that inadvertently infect the whole company! Anyways, we're lucky that Sergio turned it in rather than rummaged through it's contents. Since he found it near HR it could just belong to someone there, but we can't be too sure, right? Its been plugged into Workstation-Desk we have set up as a sheep-dip, you can find it there. Make sure not to just delete the whole drive or entire directories because even if infected, it could also have some critical HR files on it. I think we have some sort of Antivirus on that workstation called Clam Scan or something that can scan removable media. Go check it out @playerone.

I GUESS ITS LIKE THEY SAY - CURIOSITY KILLS THE CAT! HAHAHA
NOT FUNNY THOUGH YOU GUYS NEED TO CHECK THAT OUT.

Thanh Akasaka
I also noticed that the sheep-dip Workstation-Desk machine has been acting a bit weird when trying to open programs, no idea what happened there but I don't have time to look at it. So good luck.

Documentation:
According to the notes, they mentioned the machine has been funky ever since plugging in the thumbdrive. Upon investigation it seems like files has been locked down. It looks like regular user functions were disabled. So, I tried running the scanner as administrator and it was able to execute. After the scan results were provided I went into the thumbdrive and removed each file that showed were infected.

According to the Scan summary there are 4 infected files found on the drive. The remediating steps done was to locate where the files were and deleted it off the system. I used SHIFT + DELETE to permanently delete. The regular delete function doesn't remove it completely, it sends it to the recycle bin which is still located locally on the system.
