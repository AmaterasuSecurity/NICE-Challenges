I've had multiple customers complain about having to come into the store because they were unable to make purchases online due to extremely long load times.

Ricardo Cortes
Ricardo Cortes
That's pretty concerning. Is there anything else the customers have shared with you?

Jacqueline Smith

Just that the issue seems to be exacerbated during peak hours.

@asteele, are you available to work on this right now?

Ashley Steele
Ashley Steele
Actually, no. I'm pretty swamped with implementing that new ticketing system that the support staff is so eager for.

Do you know of anyone else that might have the knowledge to investigate the situation?

@playerone should have no problem taking this on. How about it, @playerone? Check out what's running on Prod-Joomla. There has to be some process that's running inefficiently or something.

1.  Went into the webgui of pfsense and looked through configurations specifically the rule sections.
2.  ssh'd into joomla through the CLI. Using playerone credentials.
3.  CD into /etc/snort/rule then nano the custom.rule file
4.  Saw a test rule in there that says it needs to be removed.
5.  commented out the rule, saved the changes, and restarted the firewall rules with systemctl restart snort command.
