    Don't forget about the account naming scheme: (First initial and last name, i.e. John Doe = jdoe)
    Password should be "Password123"
    
    
    [Thanh Akasaka](https://portal.nice-challenge.com/workspace)
    
    The new server is at the IP address 172.16.10.7. It's also listed in the network diagram in the prod subnet.
    
    
    [Gilly Bates](https://portal.nice-challenge.com/workspace)
    
    Gary is going to need permanent SUDO / Administrator privileges.
    

    [Thanh Akasaka](https://portal.nice-challenge.com/workspace)
    
    Oh, and run updates on that box. It has been a while since that version of the OS was released and there are lots of updates for the base packages. Also, make sure to use the preinstalled system package manager when you update, no built from source updates please...

### Linux Administration 101: Users, Access & Updates

*Author: James D. Ashley III*
**Framework Category:**Operate and Maintain
**Specialty Area:**Systems Administration
**Work Role:**System Administrator
**Task Description:**Install, update, and troubleshoot systems/servers. (T0418)
**Scenario**

We recently acquired a new server, put a base Linux install on it, and put it in the production subnet. This new server is going to be our production web server and we need you to get it ready for prime time. Some basic accounts will need to be added to it and given the right level of authority. Also, the server needs to be updated to the latest base packages before we let the developers into it to start loading up their stuff.

**Additional Information**

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.
You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.
Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.
Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
Username: playerone
Password: password123

# Notes

I created the user account as requested by using the **useradd -G root -p Password123 gthatcher**. *Useradd *lets you create the account *-G *tells linux the username is root and *-p *tells it this is the password to authenticate and *gthatcher *is the person we are adding.

Then I entered the command **sudo yum install *base **to update the base files as requested.

To grant superuser access to Gary. I entered the command **sudo visudo** that took me into the vim file where the sudoers are listed. I went down to the bottom of the file and pressed **a **which puts me into insertion mode that will let me input data into the file. I then entered Gary's username which is gthatcher with the options **ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL. **

To save the changes I pressed **:wq **then enter. That tells vim to saved written changes in the file.
