**Scenario**

Recently Gary Thatcher our senior system administrator, came across a thumb drive attached to an employee's system. According to the employee, the thumb drive was attached without their consent and they are unsure of the origin of said drive. The drive was passed to Ione Leventis one of our security analysts. Ione has attached the drive to our sheep-dip system which in our case is the Security-Desk machine. However, Ione was called away on other matters and you are now entrusted with the task. According to current company policy the thumb drive must be inspected for any malicious agents that could threaten DAS Web's overall security. Your job is to create a forensically sound duplicate image of the thumb drive using dcfldd so it can be examined without the risk of inadvertently modifying potential evidence. SHA512 hashes should also be taken and compared between the original thumb drive which is already attached, but not mounted, to the system and the forensic image.

**Additional Information**

More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.
You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.
Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.
Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
Username: playerone
Password: password123

    Greetings @playerone, recently I discovered a thumb drive attached to the system of an employee who will remain nameless. This is a violation of our company IT security policy. Per company policy, a forensically sound duplicate of this drive must be made in case we need to inspect it later to determine whether it is of a malicious nature and whether or not we need to get legal involved. I have assigned this task to you and I will of course check your work. Ione has further details.

    I can't believe I have to do another one of these... Oh hi @playerone. Gary Thatcher has me doing his work again so you will need to take care of this. The thumb drive that was found has been attached to our sheep-dip machine which is currently the Security-Desk machine, however it is not mounted.

    @playerone I had to do this for a drive that we found on company property once and it turns out it was our CEO's Richard LeGrand's drive I won't mention what was on it but suffice it to say, good luck...

    YES GILLY THAT WOULD BE BEST

    @playerone, you can ignore them, but obviously confidentiality is of paramount importance in this task. You will need to make a forensic duplicate of the thumb drive using the forensic utility dcfldd and the image should be stored in /forensicimages. A SHA512 hash should be taken of both the drive and of the image /forensicimages/forensicimage.dd that you will create with dcfldd and the two should be compared to one another. It's critical that these hashes match so we can be certain of the integrity of the potential evidence.

    [Ione Leventis](https://portal.nice-challenge.com/workspace)
    
    @playerone In summary you must:
    1\. Use dcfldd to make a forensically sound image and hash of the thumb drive
    2\. Store the image in /forensicimages/forensicimage.dd
    3\. Take a SHA512 hash of the thumb drive and compare it to the hash originally created with dcfldd.

### Notes:

1\. Check man pages for info on the dcfldd command.

2\. Info on dcfldd command: The if option tells dcfldd to use the specified file instead of stdin. The of option writes to the file instead of stdout. Hash option sets the specified hash format. Hashlog send the hashoutput to a file instead of stderr.

3\. Checked the directory listings with the ls command using the options -lha. The l is a lower cased "L" character not a one whichÂ  shows file or directory, size, modified date and time, file or folder name and owner of files and the permissions. Adding the "h" option shows the listings in human readable format and the "a" option shows hidden directories and files. So, with this information i used the command on the directory /dev and piped it to grep any directories or files with "sd" in it.

4\. Changed to the root directory and created a directory named forensicimages as stated in meeting notes: commands used cd / sudo mkdir /forensicimages

5\. Ran the command sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb of=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd hash=sha512 hashlog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt (This command will create the image of the target directory which is /dev/sdb to the assigned directory which is /forensicimages and name the image forensicimages.dd. We are setting the hash format to sha512 and outputting the hashing information to a txt file in the /forensicimages folder named forensicimages.txt)

6\. Once, the image is made I used sudo dcfldd if=/dev/sdb vf=/forensicimages/forensicimage.dd verifylog=/forensicimages/forensicimage.txt
